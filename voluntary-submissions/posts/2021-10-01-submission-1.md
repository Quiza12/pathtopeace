# #YESMEANSYES

# Introduction

It was a sunday night and I was sixteen. I was attending a party with most of my girlfriends. There were boys from another local school there that I wasn't familiar with. Like most parties around this time, I was drinking and planning on having a big night since it was in the middle of school holidays. I met a boy at the party, he seemed pretty nice and he offered to get me a few drinks, since I didn’t bring my own. I thought it was a bit weird that he wasn’t drinking but I didn’t really think much of it. 

# Recount

As the night went on I became more intoxicated and parts of the night are blurry, however I do remember most of it. I was still hanging out with this guy and I consented to kissing him. We had gone for some walks around the property and mingled with the rest of the party. As I became more intoxicated, I began to fall asleep in his lap. At this stage I was pretty drunk.

We proceeded to go on another walk, but this time it was different. While we were kissing he grabbed my hand and placed it on his crotch. I said I didn't want to and I explicitly said “No!” a few times, but he didn’t really care. I remember feeling so voiceless and like there was no way out of the situation but to go along with what he wanted me to do. He then proceeded to pull down his pants and he again placed my hand on his penis and started moving my hand up and down. Again I said I didn’t know what I was doing and I didn’t want to do it. He still didn’t care. He let go of my hand, but I didn’t stop because I felt like I couldn’t. I felt really powerless. Eventually, he started complaining because I wasn’t doing it right (it was my first sexual experience, so I obviously had no idea) and again said I didn’t want to do it. He grabbed my hand and “showed me” how to do it. He suggested that I give him head, but this time when I said no and refused, he listened. I don’t know how long this went on for (I was very drunk) but we had moved locations and I was now in a garage, at this point I had built up the courage to stop. When I did, he yelled at me and told me “I couldn’t stop” and it isn’t fair to give someone ‘blue balls’ (I didn’t even know what that meant at the time). Because I wouldn’t touch him again, he made me watch him finish himself off. I couldn’t leave because I was inside the garage. I remember him demanding I find something to clean himself up with. 

Not long after my dad had arrived at the party to come and pick me up. I remember getting in the car and feeling so dirty and upset, but I didn’t understand why. I never told anyone what happened to me because I felt so dirty and ashamed. I also didn’t realise it was sexual assault, because at the time I believed that only included rape. 

The first time I told anyone was two and a half years later. At this point, I still wasn’t aware that it was sexual assault, I just referred to it as a “bad thing that happened to me.” It wasn’t until earlier this year (over four years later), when I read a story almost identical to mine, did I realise I was sexually assaulted. This is only the third time I have told this story. 


# Revelations:

This was undoubtedly the worst sexual experience I’ve had but I think it is important to mention some other sexual assault microaggressions that happen ALL the time. Every single one of my female friends have experienced something similar to this. 

+ Being continually asked to send “cheeky pics” by a boy I liked for years. He knew how I felt and used it to his advantage. Implied if I sent him photos he would reciprocate his feelings for me. I said no and made it clear I was uncomfortable with the idea many times. He wouldn’t take no as an answer, so I eventually gave in since he was persistently asking me. Again in this situation, I felt so pressured into doing it, and thought it would be easier to go along with it, then keep saying no. He ended up asking me a few more times over the next year. He would use the fact that I had sent it before, as an excuse to do it again, even though I said I didn’t want to. 
+ Men (10+ years older than me) at different workplaces
	+ Finding out I was a virgin and offering to “change that for me.”
	+ Calling me pet names and making me walk alone at night with them to take the bins out. He proceeded to ask me intrusive questions, so I mentioned I was still in high school, so he would leave me alone. 
	+ While these experiences, may seem insignificant, dismissing comments and actions such as these, is what contributes to a rape culture society. To transition away from a rape culture society, behaviour like this needs to be called out. 


# Advice:

+ IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT. I spent years blaming myself for so many things i.e going to the party, drinking, taking up his offer for going for a walk, not being more firm when saying no. But what happened to me was not my fault, and it is so important for anybody who was sexually assaulted to know this. 
+ Any emotion you are feeling is valid. I suppressed all my emotions after that night, because I didn’t understand what happened to me and it seemed so much easier at the time to ignore it, than face it. It isn’t until now, that I can see so many other issues surfaced because I ignored how I was feeling. It is really hard to experience all the emotions that come with being sexually assaulted. This happened to me three and half years ago, but there are still days where I get triggered by something (such as reading similar experiences). I’ve learnt just to accept every emotion and give myself time to feel it. 
+ Tell someone. This was really hard for me, but it was so rewarding. There is so much fear correlated with talking about sexual assault experiences, particularly when you see how other brave sexual assault victims are treated. I was so scared I wouldn’t be believed or people would look at me differently. But the two people I told were incredible and made me feel so supported. It sounds super cliche, but it felt like a major weight was lifted off my shoulders. So speak up about it (whenever you are ready), I promise it is so worth it.  
+ Report it. If you are comfortable and it is something you are wanting to do there are a few ways of reporting. I know there is an option to go through the police. I have never spoken to the police about my experience, so I don’t know a lot about this process. 
	+ Here: + [Police Report](https://www.police.nsw.gov.au/crime/sex_crimes/adult_sexual_assault) for more information about how to undertake this process. 
	+ There is also an anonymous and informal reporting option known as SARO. 
	+ The main difference between the two reporting mechanisms is the latter does not automatically result in a criminal investigation being undertaken. 
	+ [Police Report - What happens?](https://www.police.nsw.gov.au/crime/sex_crimes/adult_sexual_assault/sexual_assault_categories/what_happens_to_your_report)
	+ For reporting through SARO: + [SARO](https://www.police.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/475794/SARO_Form_200213.pdf.)  
+ No matter how severe you think it is, it matters. 
+ Sexual assault is sexual assault, from acts such as rape, to inappropriate touching, staring and comments; it is NEVER okay. 
+ Please don’t downplay your experience because “it could’ve been worse”. All experiences matter. Your standard of what's ‘okay’ and ‘not okay’ must be respected.
