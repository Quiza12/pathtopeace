# #yesmeansyes 

I had been talking to this guy for a while, he used to come into my local cafe I worked at and we exchanged numbers and started talking. He seemed so lovely and had
asked me out a few times, and then bailed last minute…weird. I then went out with some girlfriends to bump into him, he was a lot older than me so I felt 
intimidated in a way, we spent the night chatting and drinking back and forth, but I really didn’t get a good vibe from him. He offered me a lift home, and as 
we lived around the corner from each other I didn’t see anything wrong with it, as we arrived at his house (the first stop) he told me that I had to earn my ride 
home, after being ushered into his house I thought, surely not. I’m a super strong person and very good at telling someone to get fucked, but there was something 
weird about this. I sat in his bedroom thinking that a 5 minute chat and I’d be able to leave, the Uber was ordered. He’d said he’d gone to get a glass of water, 
to arrive back naked, he pushed me down on his bed and forced me to orally pleasure him. I tried to push him away but got continuously pushed onto him. I was 
mortified. I got in my Uber. 

##### Crying my eyes out and have only just come to terms with how much this has affected me 2 years later.
