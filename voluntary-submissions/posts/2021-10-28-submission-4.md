I was at a New Year’s Eve party at my own house trying to have a good time with mine and my brothers’ friends when one of them wouldn’t leave me alone and continued
feeding me drinks. At some point I was in a state where I couldn’t stand, and the same guy was taking me upstairs in what I thought was a nice gesture trying to 
look after me and make sure that I was safe, but I was wrong. We got to my room, and he was forcing himself on me and I was trying to push him off and tell him that
I didn’t want to do what he was saying we should do but he wouldn’t listen to me no matter what I said or did. This continued and I think what happened next is best
left unsaid. After he left my room, he went back to the party with my friends and my brother. I was frozen and had no idea what to do. 

This experience changed me as a person and how I view my own safety as my house and my room was somewhere I always felt safe, but this was taken away from me. I had
a lot of rebuilding to do but I couldn’t bring myself to tell my brother, so the friend kept coming around until I finally built up the courage and told my brother 
a small portion of what had happened, and the friend was cut off completely. This was one of the biggest moments for me as I always felt it was my fault, that if I
wasn’t drunk or if I stayed downstairs things would have ended differently and that this awful thing wouldn’t have happened to me. But, my brothers support/love and most importantly the belief that it wasn’t my fault changed things for the better and gave me the peace of mind knowing that it wasn’t my fault and that I 
shouldn’t be ashamed. Sometimes even now I have trouble in party settings and trusting people but that is something I am working on every day.
