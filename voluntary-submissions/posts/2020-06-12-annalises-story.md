# Annalise's Story

### Introduction
Throughout the decades body image remains to be an important priority for many young adults. This often leads to one keeping a healthy diet and practising daily exercises however in my case, I went far beyond average. In this blog I will take you through my journey of poor health behaviours and how I overcame body dissatisfaction and enhanced my self-esteem.

### The social determinants of my health
Social media has been a major determinant of physical and mental health especially in younger users like myself. I have and still expose myself to ‘perfect’ like models and unrealistic body images that appear on social media such as Instagram and Facebook. I am a perfectionist who always found myself aiming for better and for more. I began monitoring my weight and participating in healthy exercising at the age of 15. However as the years went by my goals became unrealistic consequently leading to unhealthy and harmful weight loss.

### When it started to get bad
At the age of 18 I began showing symptoms of Bulimia Nervosa. These symptoms include binge eating, fasting, self-induced vomiting and excessive exercise. On some occasions I would begin my day with a fat burner supplement and eat only at night when I was with my family. Other days would be up to six hours of walking without consumption. Throughout the year I kept these behaviours to myself and would often lie to my friends and family of my consumption. During this moment I found myself more susceptible to illness and experienced episodes of fatigue and weakness. I would often disregard these symptoms and focused on losing weight.

### When it got better
One day my closest friend caught me in an act of self-induced vomiting and decided to take me to the doctors. There we discovered I was underweight. It was that day I discovered how serious my behaviours were and the importance to make a change. I was fortunate to have my friend’s support and efforts in helping me to attain a healthy weight and diet. I hadn’t known that my behaviours were not just a lifestyle choice but a mental illness. Today I try my hardest to avoid the negative side of social media that holds unrealistic body images and expectations. I carry out a healthy intake recommended by health care professionals. I believe I have overcome a major obstacle in my young adulthood and I am proud of myself to make a change for the better of my health.
