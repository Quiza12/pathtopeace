# #yesmeansyes 

At the age of 19 living on the opposite side of the world I was sexually assaulted twice in one night.

It was my last night in Edinburgh, I had lived there for a year and felt completely safe going out. Never once had I experienced anything close to make me feel 
what I felt that day. I would easily walk home from a club by myself at 4am. 

My friends and I decided to go to a club I’d never been to to celebrate the end of year and a final farewell as we were all going to be splitting up the next day. 
The only downside of this club was that it was a sandstone building meaning there is no service inside. As the night went on everyone got separated and it was myself and my male roommate. He had to go to the toilet but didn’t feel comfortable with me being alone, sohe made me stand outside the door waiting for him, he made me constantly talk/shout to him, so he knew I was there. In less than a minute I was pulled into a dark corridor. I tried fighting him, I tried screaming but nothing would stop him. I had no idea who he was. People would walk past nearby and see my crying but wouldn’t stop to help. Eventually after what felt like forever, he let me go. I sat on the ground crying until my friend found me, it turned out that I had been missing for 40 minutes, they even got someone to check to make sure I hadn’t gone home. He made me feel safe and protected, he knew all the right things to say. He tried making me go home but me being the person I am I pushed my feelings and mental stability to the side and stayed out as I didn’t want to ruin anyone's night. He didn’t know what happened to me, to him I was just crying on the ground.

Later that same night I was pulled to a dark corner of the dance floor. At this point I had little to no energy left to fight. This time I was lucky that my 
friends were there, they pulled me away, not after he’d already hurt me, but he didn’t get as far as the previous guy. I was standing on the dance floor hugging 
my best friend, with a group of my guy friends surrounding me creating a barrier between me and him until the security kicked him out. My friend then got me out 
of there. This time I didn’t break down till we got home. I didn’t feel safe anymore, I didn’t want to be alone, but I also didn’t want anyone near me. Oddly 
enough the safest place I felt was in my roommates’ arm who was a guy. I didn’t sleep the whole night, every time I closed my eyes that was all I saw. 

A couple days after that night one of my friends and a student reached to let me know that they recognised the guy from the dance floor and with my permission 
they would report him. We found out I wasn’t the only victim; he was kicked out of school (no school in Edinburgh would take him) and now he has a criminal record
that will be with him forever. 

The next day if I wasn’t on a plane, I was on the phone talking to my roommate to distract myself. I got on a plane, got home and didn’t tell a single soul and 
never spoke about it again until I had a breakdown at work almost a whole year after. At a work Christmas party a co-work made me feel uncomfortable, apparently
you could physically see me shaking. My boss and manager could see how uncomfortable I was but didn’t put a stop to it till another worker came in and got me out 
of there. I broke down in the car park, he was the first person I told. I was lucky that the guy had quit so I never had to see him again as I wasn’t sure how I’d 
feel having to see him so often. I was scared that every time I saw him it would bring back the memories I tried so hard to suppress. 

### To this day I’ve only told 5 people. 

The only reason these people know is because I had a breakdown around them, but none of them understand the way I am feeling. They don’t understand that I now 
have anxiety because of this incident and that I was depressed when I first arrived home. They don’t understand why I hate people touching me or why I don’t go 
out at night by myself anymore. 

I haven’t told my parents; I’m scared it will change the way they see me. Sometimes I wonder how different my life would be if I didn’t go out that night, what if 
he didn’t go to the bathroom, what if I wore something else(I was wearing black jeans and a red knit shirt), what if I went home after the first attack. 
What if, what if.

At the moment the only silver lining I have is that I’ve become closer to two of the people I told, one being my brother and the other my co-worker. 
They now notice my subtle changes and are more open with me which I appreciate. 

#### I will say that writing this has been therapeutic. I think it was because I was putting my feelings and experience down without the pressure of having to tell someone and have them feel sorry for me or be afraid they’d change the way they act around me.
