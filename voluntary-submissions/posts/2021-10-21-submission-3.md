# #yesmeansyes

Around the age of 20 whilst working in a city legal office, I had an experience that whilst not serious in nature, speaks volumes in general. 
I was asked out to lunch by two of the men I worked for, which I thought was very nice. Whilst at lunch, they started talking about going back to a hotel. 
It was said in a joking sort of fashion, along the lines of 'why don't we go back to a hotel after lunch'. I wasn't sure if this was a serious suggestion or 
just mucking around, so I kept laughing and saying 'sure'. If I had asked them if they were serious and they weren't, I would have looked a little foolish. 
On leaving the restaurant, I turned to the left to head back to the city and they both immediately turned right, which was towards the hotel just a few doors away. 
They appeared to be shocked that I was heading back to the city. Hadn't I just said I was up for it? So 'you weren't serious?' It was a very quiet walk back to the
office. I felt ashamed, humiliated, let down. These were two married guys (both with a history of divorce) and who I had trusted and respected and had thought it
was reciprocal. I never felt the same way about them after that and made sure I was never on my own with them again.

I had been planning to go to Europe for 6 months and was to be resigning soon so this just firmed up in my mind that I wasn't interested in coming back if asked.  
I also decided this would be my last job in the legal arena.  

## Advice 
The silver lining is that you learn not to trust men, particularly those in a more senior position, and to assume the worst, which whilst not ideal, was a form of 
self preservation. So the silver lining is another valuable life experience learnt. 

There are too many instances of inappropriate comments and touching to mention.  Sadly this became an expectation, rather than the exception. There was always a 
sense in my teen years of the guy only being after one thing, and I think women in general feel a pressure to please.

### Any sort of controlling behaviour/coercion shouldn't be necessary with a genuinely kind and caring person. Be true to yourself.
