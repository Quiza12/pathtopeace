# #yesmeansyes

I was on a trip with 3 of my other friends in the second half of last year. We had been out drinking for most of the day, but we had come home and had some dinner
and sobered up. A couple of the girls decided they wanted to go to the bar at the hotel where we were staying. We went to the bar, had a few drinks. While this was 
happening, one friend and I were sitting down by ourselves chatting, while the other two were playing pool. Two males approached them and struck up a conversation,
and the two guys invited us all back to their room to play board games. I personally didn’t want to go, but I also didn’t want to be the only one who didn’t go. The
guys had led us to believe it was just the two of them, but when we got back to the room there were at least 25 other guys.

I immediately wanted to leave, but again my friends didn’t want to. So I said I’d stay for 30 mins, but then I wanted someone to come back to the room with me. The 
2 of the girls and myself  started playing board games with a few of the guys who seemed nice, but one of the guys who we had met at the bar kept offering us all 
drugs. In particular, he was offering drinks and drugs to one of our friends that was really drunk and not playing games. After we played for around 30 mins, we 
noticed we hadn’t seen the one friend who wasn’t playing for a while. We asked around and someone said she was in the bathroom with the guy who had been offering 
her drugs. We tried to knock on the door several times because it was locked to get them to open it and check she was okay, but we heard nothing and there was no
response. Because she wouldn’t answer, I used a coin to open the door and get in. Essentially, we found her OD’d and the guy was just as fucked but cohesive.

So we pulled her out of there, and I called an ambulance and put her into the recovery position. While I was doing this and performing CPR the same guy who had 
given her the drugs came up behind me, and grabbed between my legs. Because I was so focused on my friend, I initially didn’t even register what was happening. It 
was only after one of my other friends screamed and then shouted at him to get off of me that I realised what was happening. Anyway, after all this I went to the
cops and reported the guy. They had me on the phone to the ambulance screaming, they had taken my jeans as well as a statement from me. The shitty part is, because 
both the other girls were also on drugs, they were worried their statements wouldn’t hold up in court, and that then being intoxicated would be on their permanent
records. So even though I was completely sober (I don’t do drugs and I had one drink at the bar), no one would believe my story.

So sadly, the guy got away with both giving my friend god knows what, and sexually assaulting me.Unfortunately, things like this happen constantly, and because
there’s such a strict standard of proof, so many people get ignored. 

### It really does build a culture of not wanting to report incidents :(
