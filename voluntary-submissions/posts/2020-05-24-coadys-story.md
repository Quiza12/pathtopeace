# Coady's Story

### INTRODUCTION

In 2019 my doctor diagnosed me with anorexia nervosa; and I felt ill. In my mind the term anorexia stank with rigid criteria: a vain and superficial “teen” with a morbid obsession to squeeze into a size six dress. I didn’t fit the mould. So what was wrong with me? Why was I - an overachieving, intelligent, stubborn and confident 18 year old - so afraid to eat. Unfortunately, it's taken me over 2 years, 4 hospital admissions and endless appointments to even attempt to work it out.

### YOUTH ADOLESCENCE - PROBLEMS LEADING UP TO

I always felt a need to achieve perfection. It's just part of who I am. I progressed through school as a textbook overachiever. Highly confident, headstrong, a little cocky but balanced by my tremendous passion. I devoted every inch of me to school, all in a subconscious effort to mask the pain that was corrupting me.

I grew up in a - you could say - emotionally unstable household. The tumultuous relationship between my family members, and the horrific things i experienced as a child led me to feel a deep sense of loneliness. While I wasn't diagnosed till much later I believe my anxiety began as a young child. I grew up bitter that I had missed out on the conventional childhood experiences, and that a lot of my days were filled with tears and terror. I told myself that if I could finish school with the best ATAR possible; i could leave home, go to university and begin the life that I had always wanted.

I spent my senior years solely devoted to achieving the best marks I could. I didn't have a goal, I just knew that anything less than ‘perfection’ was simply not good enough. These unrelenting standards fuelled my anxiety - so badly that it manifested physically. I would get severely sick before my exams and my blood pressure would drop so low that I would often collapse afterwards.

Whilst I achieved a fantastic ATAR, I remember opening it and being so disappointed. It didn't feel like all my problems had been solved. The pressure spiraled as I was encouraged into a top tier university degree; despite the fact that I was simply so exhausted and depressed from my efforts in school. Taking a break in my eyes would have been considered ‘failure’; so i made the decision to go - this sparked the biggest changes in my life thus far.

### ISSUES

I never thought that I would develop an eating disorder. I had always had a healthy relationship with my body, and I absolutely loved food. But that's the thing about eating disorders, they creep in so quickly and silently that before you even know what's going on you’re too entrenched. As school concluded in 2018 I considered going on a health kick. I began eating a vegan diet, and exercising a few times a week. Over the course of the coming weeks my vegan diet progressed to a no carb, no sugar vegan diet, and my exercise regime saw me running up to three times a day.  In 8 weeks I had lost over 10kilos.

Restriction allowed me to feel an overarching sense of control. maybe if I could completely control what I was eating, I wouldn’t have to worry about anything else that was going on in my life. the less I ate, the less I felt and soon I became completely numb to any emotion or feeling. I was suffering from major depression. I stopped seeing my friends, I dropped out of university, I quit my job and soon my entire life was focused around eating as little as possible, and exercising until my legs wouldn’t move.

My mental state was declining rapidly, but it wasn't until this was reflected in my physical appearance that anyone seemed to take notice. It's for this reason that sufferers of eating disorders often don’t receive help until this illness has progressed quite severely. I had started seeing a GP who initially diagnosed me with hyperthyroidism; as my hormones had stopped functioning properly. Symptoms of this illness overlap closely with anorexia nervosa; and my convincing charisma and denial of any dietary issues seemed believable enough.

### ANXIETY AND IMAGE

Anxiety began to take over my entire life. Rules and rituals became outward displays of the internal torture i was suffering. I won’t go into specific detail because I fear this seeming like a book of tips on how to starve, and I worry about the implications of my words on a diet obsessed culture.

Soon enough others started to worry about my ghastly appearance. My eyes were so empty, and my face became hollow. I could barely hold a conversation, and I spoke like a zombie. My mind was so starved, all I could think about was my next meal. Slowly my body stopped devoting the little energy it received to my other functions - my hair began falling out in clumps, I was cold all the time, my fingernails went purple and I was so fatigued. I was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa, generalised anxiety disorder and depression.

The biggest misconception I have had to deal with is the assumption that my eating disorder began with a desire to be ‘thin’. Before, I simply had no desire to change anything about my body or to lose weight. It was never a driving factor, however treatment providers place such a huge focus on the scale that it does become a maintaining factor. The more emphasis placed on my weight the more it started to concern me. Stepping on a scale became a terrifying process, because if the number went down I was failing those who were trying to help me, but if the number went up I was losing control.

-- I also want to place emphasis and advocate for the fact that eating disorders affect people of all genders and body types. You DO NOT have to be underweight to suffer from an eating disorder. Eating disorders are MENTAL illnesses, and they need to be treated as such. --

My anxiety maintained my control; and my control catalysed my anxiety. It was an endless circle of guilt and loneliness; it was a cry for help. I reluctantly continued seeing my GP in defiance of my severe discomfort. -- I also want to add a side note here and say that having a good doctor; one who advocates for you, and has taken the time to learn about mental health as a severe and debilitating illness could be the difference between recovering and staying trapped. I am so lucky to have an amazing GP who made the tough decisions for me when i was too sick to think, and consistently stood by me during all of my moments (trust me, there were a lot of moments). --

### SEEKING HELP

My GP told me that if I continued with what I was doing, I wouldn’t survive the next few months. but the entire time I was blinded by this mask of invincibility. I felt that everyone was simply over exaggerating and that I would be fine. It's only in hindsight that I can see how sick I truly was. The depression was so overwhelming that when I felt my heart palpitating after a day of eating nothing, I truly wished I would fall asleep and never wake up. Eventually I did fall unconscious at home and was rushed to hospital. Only a few weeks later I was admitted to a private hospital for treatment.

Over the past year I spent a total of 3 months in a private inpatient facility fed with copious amounts of food in order to restore my weight, and save my failing body. Each day consisted of 7 meals with complete bed rest, many sessions of group therapy, doctors, psychiatrist and dietitian appointments, blood tests and weigh-ins. I was forced to completely surrender my control.

In the hospital I was face to face with all of my biggest anxieties. The more I fed my brain, the more it started to resurface my depression, and my suicidal thoughts. I cried A LOT, and I often relied on medications to calm me down. I lived with 23 other individuals who were also suffering from eating disorders; this was both confronting and rewarding. Some of these people saw me at my absolute worst, my most vulnerable and yet still reminded me every day of my worth. It taught me that I needed to start surrounding myself with people who brought me joy and treated me with respect.

### CONCLUSION

I think it's important to note that recovering from something as serious as anorexia nervosa is a long process. Not only does it involve restoring physically, and adjusting to a weight restored body, but also rewiring the neural pathways within your brain - essentially reteaching yourself that food is not to be feared. In the beginning a lot of my friends who didn’t understand told me that in order to fix my problem ‘ I just had to eat’. if only it was as simple as that. For me, eating the foods my brain had come to fear brought so much intense guilt and anxiety that I simply couldn’t put myself through it. I couldn’t ‘just eat’ because I was paralysed by anxiety, by thoughts that weren’t rational but seemed so real.

I have been out of hospital since the beginning of March. I am currently engaging in intensive outpatient treatment which involves seeing my dietitian, psychiatrist, gp and psychologist each once per week, as well as up until recently attending a Day program three times a week at the hospital I was treated at. Recovering from an eating disorder is extremely hard. Each day I have to make the choice to recover, and willingly go against my thoughts, fears and anxiety. I believe having access to good treatment is what saved my life. It is important to seek help and support as early as possible.

I now study a degree in medicine and have found a passion in working to become a doctor and one help others in the same position as me. I'm nowhere near recovered; and my anxiety is something that I know I will have to deal with for the rest of my life.
