# Introduction

Having lived my whole life with anxiety, I can’t really pinpoint exactly where all these feelings and thoughts started. It’s a family gene, one that unfortunately was passed down to me and mostly ruined my life. It was originally a very very mild case, however, as I experienced life and relationships things only got worse as I spiraled into a very serious depression and had a very strong hate for myself during my teens. As I am about to leap into my 20s, I am doing everything I can to make sure anxiety doesn’t hold its power over me, rather I hold my power over IT.


# Youth/adolescence
 
My youth and adolescence story was a wild ride. In good and bad ways. My anxiety began to heighten as I became familiar with the structure of my family, this was at the ripe age of 4.
 
This time frame also involved copious amounts of time overthinking every situation and conversation possible that I would have to be convinced to go to school or even socialize with my friends.

I was and still am obsessed with what people think about me, I would and unfortunately still create scenarios in my head that weren’t happening and spiral into an anxiety attack if I thought people were talking bad about me behind my back.
 
This stemmed into a very intense fear of confrontation and drama. I fell into a habit where I forgive people too easily and say sorry even if I’m not the one in the wrong. 
 
This is just a brief summary.


# My relationship with my biological father
 
My mother and biological father split when I was 18 months old. From this age, my father figure in my life was my Grandpa.
 
Due to my biological father being a pilot, he was moving across Australia. At 3-4 years of age I was travelling to Darwin, Brisbane, Cairns, Adelaide and Newcastle. I was doing all of this without my security blanket, my Mum. My biological father demanded I go without her so that there weren't any ‘interruptions’ or ‘bias’ conversations going on behind the scenes. 
 
As sad and as cruel as I may sound, my biological father and his family are the reason I have such a high level of anxiety to this day. They put me in many uncomfortable positions where for example I was the one who ended up having to choose whether to spend Christmas with either my Mum, or them. Being a people pleaser, this did not go down well and I ended up having a panic attack in front of everyone at the age of 6.
 
These types of situations resulted in me dreading going to my biological grandmother's house for family events, to the point where they would have to drag me out of my Mum's car in the midst of a panic attack. They were strangers to me, they were and still are never involved or interested in my life. Why did I have to go? To keep the peace for my Mum, they would blame her for me being so anxious around them.
 
At the age of 11, my biological father, along with his partner and two children (my step-brother and sister) came to my house for a Christmas gathering. During this, he had announced he was moving to Dubai for 10 years as he had a contract with Emirates. I had no bloody idea where Dubai even was!! He then told me it was 15 hours away in another country.
 
You may think this would have been a relief for me, but it was quite the opposite.
 
After hearing this news, at 11 years old, I had it embedded in my mind that if my own biological father was to leave me this easily, then anyone would leave at the drop of a hat. This is where my attachment issues began.


# Attachment
 
Since 11 years old I have had major issues with attachment.
 
My father leaving for Dubai set a standard in my head that I would have to go above and beyond for people to even consider staying in my life. Yes, I became that weird, needy, clingy friend that everyone didn’t like. I was so obsessed with people liking and accepting me that I couldn’t get myself to stop.
 
I became that easily jealous friend if one of my ‘best-friends’ in primary school hung out with someone else or had a sleepover with another group of friends. I self-sabotaged myself into thinking that I wasn’t good enough for people to be friends with me. I would make Mum buy me the best smiggle rubbers/textas like the cool kids did so other kids would recognise me and want to talk to me. The small things like even a conversation with someone would make all the difference for me.
 
Although I am all these things (needy, clingy, desperate for approval), I am also a very bubbly, confident and happy person. As much as it is a shell to protect myself, I do enjoy feeling free of all the anxiety provoked feelings I had for all my life.
 
Starting high school was a massive thing for me. I had made a pact with myself that I would be this introverted, people-pleasing person and in that way I wouldn’t cross people's paths and bother them. Did that work? NOPE. I was used. Used for my kindness and my willingness to please people. I quickly learnt that I had to be myself, but I had no idea who I even was.
 
My attachment issues led to many issues with friends during my time in high school, I was dragged into dramas left right and centre because they knew I wasn’t capable of standing up for myself. I apologised and apologised until I had their forgiveness and approval. Even if I didn’t do a thing wrong. Obviously, some of it was my doing, navigating your way through high school, you are going to make mistakes and upset people. This was the harshest reality for me. I couldn’t please everyone.


# Losing power
 
Another thing I can’t pinpoint, is the day I allowed my anxiety to take control over me. It was such a slow build up that it ended up all crashing at once.
 
At the end of Year 10 I got myself into my first serious relationship. As all relationships do, it began with immense joy and happiness, I felt as though I had found my person, they understood my love language. To keep it short and simple, after about a year of this relationship it was a vicious and toxic cycle of emotional abuse. I had never received emotional abuse before so I wasn’t able to identify it at the time.

Being gaslighted is probably the worst feeling ever. If you aren’t aware, gaslighting is a form of emotional abuse. It’s the act of manipulating a person by forcing them to question their thoughts, memories and the events occurring around them. It forced me to question a lot more than that thought. I questioned my existence, myself and who I was, I couldn’t understand why I was forced to believe that I was the one that was always in the wrong.
 
There were countless times I was left sitting in my room bawling my eyes out because this person would refuse to tell me a time they were meeting up with me because they had better things to do; it would be 11pm and I would have heard nothing. I couldn’t go out with my friends without worrying a snapchat story could trigger them to send me abusive messages and threaten to leave.
 
The worst part is, I confided in them. They knew about my fear of abandonment. They used this and treated it like their playground. They found it fun. At least it was for them.
 
This toxic cycle resulted in me having around 2-3 panic attacks a week. It became the new norm for me. I thought this is what love was. As much as I had desperately wanted to, I couldn’t find it in myself to let go.
 
I remember the conclusion of this relationship.
 
I was at dance class with all my friends when I had received the most terrifying message: “we need to talk”. I Immediately knew what this meant. Without even caring about my surroundings I fell into one of the most terrifying attacks yet. This wasn’t any panic attack, it was a full blown anxiety attack. Yes, to me, there is a difference. My anxiety completely took over me and I was laying outside the studio on the concrete shaking in fear of being left and being so worked up that I was vomiting.
 
Just a subtle warning that from here it gets a bit deep..
 
After this relationship ended, I fell into a massive depression. I thought that no one would ever love me again. I would go on drives in the midst of a panic attack (so dumb Abbey what were you THINKING!!) and try to convince myself not to drive into a tree or off-road. I would find myself home alone and standing Infront of the bathroom cabinet looking at all the pills I could take and it would be over. I often caught myself looking in the mirror, seeing this sad, depressed and helpless human who just wanted to end their suffering. I researched every pill in the cabinet to see which one would have the most effect. But due to my severe phobia of vomiting, I never had the guts to take them (thank goodness), even though my mind was telling me it was the only way out.
 
Mum and Dad saw this depression from a mile away and immediately booked me in to get a mental health plan and start seeing a psychologist. I vividly remember her asking me, “Do you have a suicide plan?” and I stopped and thought about this question for a bit. I told her that I don’t have the guts to do it to myself, I just hoped and prayed that somehow I would be involved in some sort of car crash or something of that severity where it was out of my control. But I desperately wanted it to happen.

This all stemmed from my attachment issues and my anxiety surrounding that. Crazy.


# Attempt at recovery
 
To this day I am still working on my recovery. And I am sure I will be for years and years to come.
 
To be completely honest, finishing high school was the best thing that could have ever happened to me, I was enrolled in a primary education degree at UOW, I didn’t have to keep toxic friendships and relationships if I didn’t want to. I finally felt a sense of control in my life.
 
Everytime I tell someone about how I am studying to be a primary school teacher, they praise me about the holidays I get. But it is soooo much more than that! I want to make a difference, I want to be that teacher that students feel comfortable coming to about absolutely anything. With this though, comes a lot of pressure, mostly that I put on myself to be that ‘perfect teacher’.
 
I don’t want to come home from teaching worrying and stressing about certain children who might not be living in stable environments or have a similar experience with anxiety that I had at their age.
 
(*Have to pull myself up here lol. Read that last paragraph again and tell me I’m not overthinking and creating scenarios in my head ahahaha* Will I ever learn? Probably not, but I’m trying.)

Things that I find helpful to my recovery:

+ Surrounding myself with amazing people who genuinely care about me and love me
+ Doing all the things that I love (art, dancing, netball, going to the gym, socializing with my friends)
+ Being true to yourself and slowly learning that you are who you are and to embrace that
+ Scheduling!!!! With a very very mild form of OCD, I love organising and scheduling, it gives me piece of mind and motivation
+ Reading – I have always enjoyed reading. Although, I often tend to lean towards the very sad and depressing books, - weirdly – it gives me perspective and allows me to recognise the things I really am grateful for
+ Spending time with my family


# Conclusion
 
Although my story may not be as interesting as others, it’s my story and in some weird way, I take pride in it. It’s made me who I am today.
 
I often used to question why things would happen to me and why I felt the way I felt. But fast forward to today Sunday 11th July 2021, 3:36pm, I have so much to be grateful for and I am so proud of the person I am today.
 
I am strong. I am resilient. I am me.
 
As cliché as that may sound. It’s true. I’m on the right path and I’m slowly getting better at trusting it.
 
I am surrounded by such amazing people. A lot of how I have changed in a very positive way has to be given credit to all the people I work with at my current job. They inspire me every day to have fun, be who I am, and live without any worries. They all have my back and have never had that in a workplace before.
 
Even through all my hardships, I am so lucky.
