Rape comes in many forms and means different to a multitude of people. However the universal word of no means no, my story is how people push no to become yes. Persistence to change an answer is not the answer. If you have to ask, beg or tell someone it will make me feel better if your having a bad day or a bad thought to make a person give you some action it’s rape. My experience in a past relationship was sexual acts were the bargaining power, when asked originally if I felt up to it, my response would be not today I’m not feeling in the mood. His response would be “baby I’m having a bad day, it would make me feel better or more like myself” even after that I would say no, and it would become my fault he was in a depressive state that day, I would be asked until I gave in, and even then when I did the response would be “you don’t seem into it, you need to be into it so I can feel better”. 

### No means no. If you get 100 no’s and one yes at the end that’s coercion and rape.
