![Jonathan's Story](/voluntary-submissions/images/vt-5.jpg)

I’ve probably had issues with anxiety since childhood, but for me the problems became more pronounced in my early 30’s. Perhaps it was an early mid-life crisis.
My life had become very centred on work and around this time I started to lose direction and motivation. Many of the things I’d been focusing on and working towards
no longer felt so important (e.g. achievements, wealth, possessions, etc). We’d been living abroad for a long while so connection to family and long-time friends 
had diminished. Career-wise I had been successful but was not really enjoying work anymore. I felt like I didn’t fit in to the industry I worked in, which was very 
materialistic and money focused. I began to think of it as a means to an end. Something to endure since the money was good and would set us up for happy times later
on.
