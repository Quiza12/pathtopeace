I’ve probably had issues with anxiety since childhood, but for me the problems became more pronounced in my early 30’s. Perhaps it was an early mid-life crisis.
My life had become very centred on work and around this time I started to lose direction and motivation. Many of the things I’d been focusing on and working towards
no longer felt so important (e.g. achievements, wealth, possessions, etc). We’d been living abroad for a long while so connection to family and long-time friends 
had diminished. Career-wise I had been successful but was not really enjoying work anymore. I felt like I didn’t fit in to the industry I worked in, which was very 
materialistic and money focused. I began to think of it as a means to an end. Something to endure since the money was good and would set us up for happy times later
on.

In the midst of all this I started to experience panic attacks in work settings. The weekly team meeting became a dreaded time of the week. When it was my turn to
speak I would find my heart pounding, chest tightening, gasping for air and struggling to get any words out. I guess the pauses were not as long as they felt in my 
mind. I’m sure they would’ve been noticeable and awkward, although no-one ever spoke to me about it and I never sought help except to try and “fix the problem” 
myself. I tried some techniques such as self-talk and slow deep breathing, and these helped to some extent although looking back now I guess I was only scratching
at the surface.

I’ve never been diagnosed with clinical anxiety so it’s hard for me to say exactly what I struggle with, but when I scan the literature I recognise various symptoms
from generalised anxiety, social anxiety, skin-picking, hoarding, imposter syndrome, and panic attacks. That’s quite a list and I’m probably making it sound a lot 
worse than it is. Admittedly this has been on a relatively mild level and usually beneath the surface. I’ve never been formally diagnosed or treated, so some may 
say it’s all in my own head or just a neurotic personality. At times these various forms of anxiety have led to periods of low mood and lethargy, which I recognise
now might have been mild depression. And I understand this pattern is quite common for anxiety and depression to go together and feed off each other.

I’m glad to say I’m in a much better place nowadays. A lot of this could be due to changes in situation, as we relocated back to Australia to be closer to family and a slower pace of life. I’ve shifted to part-time work with a much better life balance including parenting, study and volunteering. I no longer have a feeling of being out of kilter with my values. Many of these things may have been what the panic attacks were trying to tell me in the first place. You wouldn’t think so at the time, but sometimes looking back these dark moments can actually be important messengers, rather than problems to be fixed or avoided.
