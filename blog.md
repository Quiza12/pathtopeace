A monthly blog with a topic per month. These can be complemented with videos and external sources. They are intended to pose a challenge to you for that month, depending on the topic.

For instance, the second month revolves around Breathing Techniques, and with the provided information we pose a challenge to you to focus on these techniques in your own life when need be.

Like the voluntary submissions, we are [accepting submissions](mailto:lachlan.querzoli@gmail.com) in regards to a month-topic.
