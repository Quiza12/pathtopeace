Music can have a huge influence on mental health. This section contains an embedded music playlist from the official Path to Peace YouTube channel. It is a frequently updated playlist of bright, colourful, peaceful music.

Additionally, some of my personal favourites will be linked through my personal channel.

Instrumentals will be included as well

Feel free to send in any recommendations to add to the playlist. All about the good vibes and happy thoughts!
