Music can have a huge influence on mental health. This section contains an embedded music playlist from the official Path to Peace YouTube channel. It is a frequently updated playlist of bright, colourful, peaceful music.

The idea is to create an atmosphere which encourages a free, joyous feeling, inciting creativity, and serving as inspiration through the mental mountains we all face. Music can act as something more powerful than the issues you face. 

Accepting instrumentals as well! 

Feel free to send in any recommendations to add to the playlist. All about the good vibes and happy thoughts!
