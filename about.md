Hi! My name is Lachlan Querzoli.

I am a 19 year old from Sydney, Australia. I am currently studying Primary Teaching at Notre Dame University Sydney. Experiencing patterns of anxiety and depression has been a prominent part of my life for a long time. Just like anyone, I don’t have all the answers. I am not a therapist, and I am still very young. I know but one thing. I know me. I know my experience. I know how IT feels, and I am here to help. I aim, using my own experience with these struggles in unison with my own success experiences, to help you. I am in a much better place mentally now in comparison to previous years - and I don’t plan to stop. I want to help you know how, so you realise why. Together we can find what works for each of us. Together we can find our own form of therapy. Together we can get through this. Because this isn’t some incurable disease. This isn’t a never-ending plight. This is life! It can be excruciating and exhilarating simultaneously. Together we can take the good with bad. Together we can ride the bumps and turns on this path of life. Together we will be okay!
