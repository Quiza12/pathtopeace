‘Little Wins’ are a collection of healthy spare-time activities to indulge in. These are designed to help you get through the day, granting you another “win” for the day.

These are great for awkward, inconvenient amounts of time that arise due to unprecedented schedule changes, and the inconsistent ever-changing ways of life.

Citing from personal experience, these have all had an extremely positive impact on my mental health, as I said before, granting a 'little win' as I continue with the day. These have improved my mood, focus and productivity.

# 10 minute Activities
## Walk
A simple walk around the block can do absolute wonders! Whether it be around the block from where you work, or your house,  or on the moon- it doesn’t matter. Everyone can benefit from a nice, easy walk for around 10 minutes to inhale some fresh air, and calm the body when it tenses due to built-up stress and anxiety.

## Yoga
10 minute yoga class
Personally, I quickly did this one before work. I was ready around 10 minutes earlier than usual, so I grabbed my yoga mat (can be done on carpet if need be) and got into it. I felt instantly energised, and full of life. I got to work on time, and felt 100% ready to attack the workload ahead of me.
