‘Little Wins’ are a collection of healthy spare-time activities to indulge in. These are designed to help you get through the day, granting you another “win” for the day.

These are great for awkward, inconvenient amounts of time that arise due to unprecedented schedule changes, and the inconsistent ever-changing ways of life.

Citing from personal experience, these have all had an extremely positive impact on my mental health, as I said before, granting a 'little win' as I continue with the day. These have improved my mood, focus and productivity.

Little Wins can range from activities of

### Walk
A simple walk around the block can do absolute wonders! Whether it be around the block from where you work, or your house,  or on the moon- it doesn’t matter. Everyone can benefit from a nice, easy walk for around 10 minutes to inhale some fresh air, and calm the body when it tenses due to built-up stress and anxiety.

### Yoga
10 minute yoga class
Personally, I quickly did this one before work. I was ready around 10 minutes earlier than usual, so I grabbed my yoga mat (can be done on carpet if need be) and got into it. I felt instantly energised, and full of life. I got to work on time, and felt 100% ready to attack the workload ahead of me.

# 30 minute Activities
+ Yoga
+ Walk
+ Exercise/Workout

### Yoga
+ Working on opening all areas of the body
+ Personally: I personally enjoyed this class. It was very challenging at times, but the class was all about easing into the stretch. Starting slow, and building until you reach your maximum point. I felt great relief afterwards, 100% woken up with a burst of energy and more mobility in my legs and hips.
#### Full Body Flexibility Yoga

#### Vinyasa Slow Flow Yoga Stretch

+ Personally: I enjoyed both these classes, with the ‘Slow Flow’ session being my favourite as it sparked something in me despite me feeling very tired before the session. These sessions really opened up my entire body, and especially my hips. Like the other classes, it unlocked a newfound energy for me to incorporate a healthy breakfast and a morning walk- all into a highly productive day!

### Walk
+ As mentioned in the 10 minute activities, a simple walk can do wonders
+ With 30 minutes on your side, this allows for a longer walk to really stretch those legs and allow more stress alleviation
+ You can even jump in your car and drive to a local park with (or without) your pet to really give you some space and freedom

### Exercise/Workout
+ Have a look at some of Evie’s Exercises! These can help make up the 30 minute time span you have. Easy-to-organise home workouts, no membership needed!
+ Here are the general examples
  + Running
  + Swimming
  + Organised sport
  + Gym
  + Walking/Power walking 
  + Biking
  + Home workouts
+ Experiment with these as well- try some variations of say, a Run-Swim combo, Home workout-Gym, etc.
+ You can even invest in a bike (if without one already) and try implementing it into your daily routine (bike to work, bike to train station, bike to gym)
+ Get creative, but understand your limits

# 1 hour Activities
+ Yoga
+ TED Talks
+ Social Time

### Yoga
A 1 hour yoga session with a mix of of Vinyasa Yoga and Vin Yoga. Personally: I personally really enjoyed this class. I liked how the first half (Yinyasa) was active, challenging and full of rapid routines, while the second part (Yin) was focused on long stretching, breathing and focus. This allowed a gradual ease into a stretch, inducing an open feel afterwards.
