‘Little Wins’ are a collection of healthy spare-time activities to indulge in. These are designed to help you get through the day, granting you another “win” for the day.

These are great for awkward, inconvenient amounts of time that arise due to unprecedented schedule changes, and the inconsistent ever-changing ways of life.

Citing from personal experience, these have all had an extremely positive impact on my mental health, as I said before, granting a 'little win' as I continue with the day. These have improved my mood, focus and productivity.
