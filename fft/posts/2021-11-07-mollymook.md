Here is a poem I’ve written titled Mollymook. It captures a time in my life the mental and physical place I was in. This was around the start of 2020. I had just been fired from a job I loved and I felt like I was back where I started. I didn’t know what direction I wanted my life to go, and I just felt like I was swimming in circles, barely able to stay afloat. This poem derived from that place.

I like to think the poem is an existential crisis come to life. An exploration of a man who is on the edge of giving up, but is conflicted for a number of reasons. With so many questions, all he wants is to let go. To let go of his past life, the mistakes, the ‘could’ve-beens’. He feels cornered, confused, desperate and hopeless. It was very therapeutic to write this as I explored these things in depth with myself and with my mentor/therapist

The trip to Mollymook was a time where I just need to be anywhere but where I was. I just needed to get out and be on my own for a moment. I stayed in a dingy old trailer in the backyard of an old man who lives alone. I was really struggling with thoughts of suicide at this time, and it’s evident through the poem. So, there’s your warning.

I should also mention that the poem is an adaptation or remix of Colors and Shapes by Mac Miller, one of my favourite songs ever. Listen to it first if you have the time. 


So, here is Mollymook by Lachlan Querzoli






### A deep dive

*"Searching for light in the darkest abyss it reminds me of why I’m alone."*
   + The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.
