Here is a poem I’ve written titled Mollymook. It captures a time in my life the mental and physical place I was in. This was around the start of 2020. I had just been fired from a job I loved and I felt like I was back where I started. I didn’t no what direction I wanted my life to go, and I just felt like I was swimming in circles, barely able to stay afloat. This poem derived from that place.

I like to think the poem is an existential crisis come to life. An exploration of a man who is on the edge of giving up, but is conflicted for a number of reasons. With so many questions, all he wants is to let go. To let go of his past life, the mistakes, the ‘could’ve-beens’. He feels cornered, confused, desperate and hopeless. 

The trip to Mollymook was a time where I just need to be anywhere but where I was. I just needed to get out and be on my own for a moment. I stayed in a dingy old trailer in the backyard of an old man who lives alone. I was really struggling with thoughts of suicide at this time, and it’s evident through the poem. So, there’s your warning.

I should also mention that the poem is an adaptation or remix of Colors and Shapes by Mac Miller, one of my favourite songs ever. Listen to it first if you have the time. 


So, here is Mollymook by Lachlan Querzoli



I took a lil trip down the coast for the weekend I needed a chance to escape

I met this old man by the name of- don’t matter, but he let me stay in his place

He lived all alone with these pictures around him he told me they’d all gone away

I thought to myself what’s the point in surviving if this is the life that awaits

But when I see the horizon and open my eyes on whats potent I start to relent

“You live and you die” as a statement as plain as the reasons you fight to the end

I just need something deeper, been searching forever I’m down on my knees hold my hand

I don’t have all the answers but push on the pain keep on searching and we’ll understand





It’s my life let me go

If it’s my time let me go

It’s my life let me go

Lord I wish I could let, go





I took a lil’ swim with the stars in the deep end I stopped for a breath and I dove

<a href="#fiveMinutes"> Searching for light in the darkest abyss it reminds me of why I’m alone.</a>

When leaving my home I just waived them goodbye like there’s no need to worry ‘bout me

If I’m right to perceive and prepare for the worst am I wrong to embrace it with glee?

But see you wish that you could and they wish that you didn’t it’s so hard to know who to please

I see through the lies of the ones who control us I trust in that karma for greed

Arrangements are made and the stones have all turned and so this is my final goodbye

Please just know that I’m with you the mourning will wake you and show you what comes at a price





It’s my life let me go!

If it’s my time let me go!

It’s MY life let me go!

I just wish I could let, go…

The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.
