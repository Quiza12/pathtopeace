I had a meeting with a mentor/therapist recently and we did a pretty intense dive into myself and spiritual desires. Specifically, a deep dive into my personal 
wants, needs, sense of purpose, sense of fulfilment and my overall struggle with managing all of them.

I’ve recently found myself increasingly frustrated at the many things I like to fulfil, but not having the time and even the motivation to fulfil them. I make 
these unrealistic expectations of myself with my projects/interests/passions and for some reason they seem realistic to me. It’s become such a turmoil that with 
certain projects, passions and interests I’ve started to feel at odds towards them as if I don’t want to pursue them anymore. It’s a frustrating feeling.

We started to look into Path to Peace, and my struggles with fulfilling the expectations I had and still have for it. We broke it down layer by layer and I came 
to really understand why I do Path to Peace, and it’s to help people struggling like me. I forgot that along the way, however. He even states how he feels that 
way with his work, and that some days he just feels in conflict with it for some reason. But, it’s completely normal. It’s completely normal to hit a wall with 
something you love. It’s natural.

From here, we explored every facet of my life, and how it’s progressed. What am I proud of in the last 3 months? What am I proud of in the last year? 3 years?

That’s when it hit me. I haven’t once stopped to acknowledge what I’m proud of over the past 2-3 years. As we dove into all the things I’m proud of, the list went
on and on. And no I don’t say that to brag or gloat, because you have things to be proud of too. 

I want you to stop and think for a moment. Recount the past month and ask yourself; 
*What am I proud of? 

Recount the past year and ask yourself; 
*What am I proud of?

Recount the past couple years and ask yourself; 
*What am I proud of?

Doesn’t matter how big or small it is. Anything that comes to mind where you’ve seen growth, recognised change or taken a next step in a certain area; acknowledge 
it and be proud.

I became very emotional during this process and cried a lot. But it was happy tears. A chance for me to slow down and really breathe for the first time in a 
couple years. It felt great, and I want you to do the same. We all have things to be proud of, but we move through this life so quickly and unconsciously that we 
forget to pat ourselves on the back every so often.

### So, stop what you’re doing and be proud!
