                                TRUST IN TIME!
                  
As generic as that sounds, it’s one of the main constants I’ve encountered in the past couple years. Living with constant anxiety, I bounce from the past and the future so erratically; it’s hard to stay grounded in the present. For some time I never had the confidence, the internal reassurance that the future would eventually pan out. I didn’t know how I could even be reassured until the future arrived.

I heard a saying around a couple years ago (2019) that went something like; “Where you are right now is exactly where you wanted to be a year ago”. It was hard to trust that advice when I originally heard it. I was in such a pessimistic, closed-minded attitude which didn’t have the capacity for a positive outcome/s.

I can safely say that, where I am right now, is exactly where I wanted to be a year ago. I still deal with some of the same problems of the past, but I have reached certain heights and experienced things I couldn’t have even fathomed in 2019. 

+ I now have an incredible girlfriend, who understands my past and respects my future.
+ I now have a volunteer position in my desired career, for experience purposes.
+ I now have a job in line with my career choice.
+ I am playing sports and exercising in a more efficient and flexible manner.
+ I’ve been able to return to AFL, one of my core passions since I was young. It’s brought me so much satisfaction and motivation.
+ I am really happy where my friendships are and where they’re heading.

I don’t list these things to ‘flex’ or brag. I list these things because I’m proud. I’ve spent a lot of my life too afraid to acknowledge or even talk about my achievements/the things I have going for me. I never want to come across as bragging and egotistical, which is a rational and valid consideration. Although It’s been so bloody unbearable at some points these past couple years, honesty will always be relevant! Me writing this to you is my way of telling you that I am happy and content with life at the moment, based on my issues of previous years. 

I still have things I need to improve on if I want to ensure an improved future. That’s the beauty of it. Keep on swimming. Keep on moving forward with a goal in sight to take you away from the irrational mental strain over the mistakes of the past, and the uncertainty of the future. If you don’t have that goal, keep searching. Nothing good ever comes easy. Even at this moment, I have certain things I worry about and I question whether I’ll ever resolve them in the future. For instance, I often worry about the future of Path to Peace and staying consistent with it as each day goes by. I worry about my music, I worry about my job, I worry about relationships. But, if there’s anything I’ve learnt in the past couple years is to trust in time, and that it will all work out eventually. I know it will, and the ‘trust’ part is half the battle.

                        As I stressed before, TRUST IN TIME!. 

### That’s the best advice I can ever give you. If you think you’ve already trusted in time enough, you need to trust more.
