    The best advice I can give you: Trust in time
                  
As generic as that sounds, it’s one of the main constants I’ve encountered in the past couple years. Living with constant anxiety, I bounce from the past and the future so erratically; it’s hard to stay grounded in the present. For some time I never had the confidence, the internal reassurance that the future would eventually pan out. I didn’t know how I could even be reassured until the future arrived.

I heard a saying around a couple years ago (2019) that went something like; “Where you are right now is exactly where you wanted to be a year ago”. It was hard to trust that advice when I originally heard it. I was in such a pessimistic, closed-minded attitude which didn’t have the capacity for a positive outcome/s.

I can safely say that, where I am right now, is exactly where I wanted to be a year ago. I still deal with some of the same problems of the past, but I have reached certain heights and experienced things I couldn’t have even fathomed in 2019.
