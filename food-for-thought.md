Food For Thought are small, miscellaneous pieces of information I like to produce randomly. These will mostly consist of personal anecdotes from myself, but can really be anything. Any topics addressed here are most likely minor topics, not broad enough for a monthly blog. These may even be added to monthly blogs as complementary pieces. For instance, one will be one a small life hack I encounter and recommend, while another could be about. [These can also be voluntarily submitted as well](mailto:lachlan.querzoli@gmail.com).

As the saying goes, they are simply ‘food for thought’ as you get on with your day.

Short, to the point, easy to consume and meant to incite positive, forward-thinking.

Think of them as little things to remember on your path; small reminders to keep you on your path.
