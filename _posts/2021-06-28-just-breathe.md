Have you ever caught yourself in the middle of a stressful situation? Is this ‘situation’ an everyday experience? Notice your breathing pattern. Most likely you would have been breathing short, small breaths at a rapid pace- barely giving your body something to work with. Learning to breathe in a healthy manner is absolutely essential for all areas of health. Here’s the how and why.

# Breathing techniques:

A special tip for breathing is to focus on the oxygen reaching all areas of your respiratory system. When we breathe, we rarely let oxygen reach the lower parts of the lungs and the diaphragm. To let the oxygen reach these areas, focus on pushing your stomach out when breathing in, and pushing it back in when you breathe out. 

Here’s a small diagram of the Diaphragmic Breathing Technique:

### As stated in the article:
“Diaphragmatic breathing is intended to help you use the diaphragm correctly while breathing to:
+ Strengthen the diaphragm
+ Decrease the work of breathing by slowing your breathing rate
+ Decrease oxygen demand
+ Use less effort and energy to breathe”

+ Combines breathing and muscle control
+ Here is an excerpt taken from webmd.com:

  1. Lie comfortably on the floor.
  2. Take a few deep breaths to relax.
  3. Breathe in. Tense the muscles of your feet.
  4. Breathe out. Release the tension in your feet. 
  5. Breathe in. Tense your calf muscles.
  6. Breathe out. Release the tension in your calves.
  7. Work your way up your body. Tense each muscle group. This includes your legs, belly, chest, fingers, arms, shoulders, neck, and face.

## Box Breathing (4-4-4-4)
+ Inhale for 4 seconds
+ Hold for 4 seconds
+ Exhale for 4 seconds
+ Hold for 4 seconds
+ Try some positive affirmations (whatever helps put a smile on your face, and reassures you)
  + “I’ll be okay”
  + “I am right in this moment”
  + “I am strong”

## Benefits of placing an emphasis on breathing techniques 

### Personally:
These techniques pose various benefits for mental health. Speaking from experience, taking a small break out of my day to practice this technique has done wonders. These have helped calm down the ‘butterflies’ I get on a daily basis. I’ve used these especially during times where I’ve been anxious about multiple things at the same time. Whether these are valid things to worry about, in that moment was not the time to distinguish that. In those moments of high anxiety and stress, these breathing techniques are vital to relieve stress, and use that nervous energy to move forward. 

By assisting in blood circulation, it returns blood flow to other parts of the body, especially the brain- where problem solving and rational thinking can be exercised. You allow your body to work at its most efficient. Additionally, breathing through the nose is highly recommended, as cited in James Nestors’ Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art; “we can absorb about 18 per cent more oxygen than by just breathing through the mouth”. Breathing through the nose also humidifies air, removes foreign particles, and boosts nitric oxide (allowing blood, nutrients and oxygen to reach all areas of the body with efficiency).

It’s important to catch yourself in these situations and start to practice healthy breathing techniques like the ones mentioned above. There’s no point in trying to work through anxiety without taking care of your anxiety. They are great to rejuvenate the mind and body, easing you to be rational-thinking, relaxed and focused.

### The Science Behind It:
Healthy, focused breathing allows us to tap into certain nervous systems to achieve a peaceful state. Our ‘fight or flight’ mode is constantly in use, whether we know it or not. It’s our sympathetic nervous system that kicks in this mode, and this nervous system is in use MOST of the time during the day. We run anxious with this sympathetic nervous system, jumping from issue to issue in our heads before (pre-worrying) and after (future-worrying) the present.

The Parasympathetic nervous system is the key. This system is the body's natural method to slow down and calm down. When the body registers that you are safe and things are stable, the parasympathetic response or the ‘rest and digest’ response. While this is a natural response to stress and anxiety, you can train yourself to access this by manually tapping into the parasympathetic nervous system, through what’s called the Vagus Nerve.

# + [The Vagus Nerve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPH5CFSmYEU)

The Vagus Nerve not only triggers the parasympathetic response, but it can transmit signals in both directions (body>brain and brain>body) when assessing situations. 

Here are four ways to control the vagus nerve to kick in the parasympathetic response to manage your anxiety and stress:

## 1. Vagal Tone and Deep Breathing
Vagal Tone is a measurement of the strength of your parasympathetic response. Just like a muscle, it can be trained. Feel your vagal tone by;
+ Find your pulse
+ Conduct slow, deep breaths 
+ Notice your heart rate
  + It should increase as you inhale, and decrease as you breath out
+ The slower the heart rate is on the exhale, the stronger your vagal tone is
+ Strong vagal tone is generally associated with a healthy lifestyle, of
  + Better blood sugar regulation
  + Better heart health
  + Improved digestion
  + Reduction in migraines
+ Weak vagal tone is generally associated with an unhealthy lifestyle
  + Mood instability
  + PTSD
  + Depression
  + Diabetes
  + Cognitive impairment
  + Inflammation
Deep slow breathing increases vagal tone = triggering the parasympathetic response.

## 2. Softening the eyes and Peripheral vision
The eyes soften when the body calms down and relieves anxiety. It is often experienced when you daydream or get lost in thought; your eye muscles soften. Tunnel vision is a sympathetic response, while softening the eyes is a parasympathetic response. 
How to soften the eyes:
+ Squeeze them tight and then release
+ Tap into your peripheral vision,
  + Similar to when you enter a daydream of some sorts
+ Allow your eyes to drift off, which lets them relax

## 3. The Valsalva Maneuver
+ Increasing pressure in chest cavity
+ Weird technique but,
  + Squatting down as if you're doing a no. 2
  + Take a breath, hold, and tense chest area as if your squeezing
+ 5 second breath, hold and bear down for 5 seconds (making some pressure in the chest, exhale for 5 seconds

## 4. The Yawn
+ Making that ‘arr’ sound to trigger a yawn response
+ This can trigger the parasympathetic response

### Challenge Time:
Try ONE of these per day! 

It can be at any time, but especially when the anxiety and stress starts to build. If you can fit 3 of these in a day, I recommend one in the morning, one around lunchtime, and one during the afternoon/night. This schedule can help keep you balanced during the 3 pivotal times of the day. 
Give it a go!!!
