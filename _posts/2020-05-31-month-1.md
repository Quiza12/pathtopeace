# Lachlan Querzoli
## Introduction
It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when it all started. Even through all of the struggle, there were still clear moments of joy. I guess it started with the anxiety, and that began to surface when I began adolescence- age 13. The anxiety began with adolescence, which turned into a deep depression leading into ages 17-18-19, that eventually lead to an impromptu suicide attempt.

## Youth/Adolescence
Anxiety was easily the defining issue of my Youth-Adolescence. It was the constricting type; forcing me to overthink every little thing to the point where I didn’t do anything. I constantly had a low self esteem for the long term, and a general awkward/worrisome feeling for the short term. These stemmed from the anxiety at its core, which I believe I’ve always had and it has helped make and break me at points.

I’ve always had a vivid imagination- a double edged sword. I imagined a future in which I could live the life of my dreams, but when it came to fulfilling that dream I fell short due to my uncanning ability to overthink. I believe this is where it all started. 

### AFL
From running out there on the field as young as 3, to watching my Sydney Swans win the 2005 AFL Grand Final in incredible fashion, AFL was the dream. I loved the team-driven mentality, the multiplicity of ways to make a difference, and the culture. From that young of an age, it was all about footy. Kicking the ball out front, at the local oval, and of course, game day. I was so full of confidence and excitement. I was always VERY emotional about the game as well. I remember crying into mum and dads arms after we lost a game. I HATED losing. But I practiced and practiced, and got better.

I became pretty good as a young kid, in multiple representative teams. I eventually scored my way into the Sydney Swans Academy, for perfecting players in the hopes of preparing them for the Sydney Swans squad. I had a great 4 years (I think!) in the academy. I made great friends, and learnt a lot about the game. Unfortunately, I never was able to progress past the first couple of cuts made. This rocked me a bit. It was kinda the first time I didn’t get something to go my way, despite my consistent effort. First lesson learnt: Can’t have everything. Eh, dreams die off. New ones arise. New ‘something’.

I attended therapy for my rising anxiety with AFL and my future. I was very much worried about this ‘dream’ of mine and my future without it. Without the AFL, I didn’t exactly have a new direction or a plan B. Although the therapy helped, it only calmed and reassured me for that day and the next. It didn’t exactly ‘heal’ the wound. I continued to experience this anxiety. Both short term and long term. It wasn’t all bad. I had a great family to always bring me back to earth. A great group of friends old and new. Life was okay. 

It took me a couple years, but I did get over this bump in the road. It wasn’t that the dream was impossible at this point, but I guess I started to enjoy footy as a sport to be competitive in without the sense of pressure to not be good enough. Moving forward, I started to enjoy the game for what it was, a game. Of course I had anxiety while playing, who doesn’t. But it wasn’t controlling me in a way that I couldn't enjoy the sport. Second lesson learnt: Don’t take everything so serious, prioritise having some fun. 

### Adolescence
Adolescence was a confusing, frustrating period. Puberty, dating, high school. Simply put, I had so many emotions and I didn’t know where to put them. I was often shifting gears from an extravagant, confident extrovert- to a shy, awkward introvert. It felt as if I was living two lives and there was a general sense of instability which was confusing and uncomfortable. There’s certain things I’m not exactly comfortable going into detail about (yet). A couple things I will mention is
+ I was part of several relationships, many of them falling short as a result of my anxiety and insecurities- issues on my end which they had nothing to with. One in particular, which I believe is the case for many young people- I was afraid to tell someone how I felt about them. 
+ Being a late bloomer in the era of puberty had me frustrated and restless- in an all boy high school this added to the confusion. Just like any young, growing organism I was just trying to find my way in life.
+ I was involved in a car crash, which was just very traumatic. In a state of shock, I fled the scene (stupid in hindisght, i know), and had to deal with the police. The after effects of being in a huge debt from this stirred in some deep regret and these irrational thoughts that my life was over. At 17.
+ I had a confusing tug of war between different sexualities, and couldn't exactly put my foot in either.

## Depression
Ages 17-18 were years 11 and 12 of my schooling career… yeah. I intensely worried about performing well at school, but was too anxious to ever grasp a consistent study schedule. Add in the challenge of starting at a school where there were GIRLS! AHHHHH!!! Scary. I carefully lived, worrying about what others thought of me in such a high pressure environment. 

While I performed pretty well in my year 12 assessment year, I HATED SCHOOL. Not the people, but the work and pressure. I still didn’t know what I wanted to do as a career at the end of year 12, so sitting through hours and hours of content I mostly didn’t care about was frustrating. Alas, I made it through the school part. In spite of this, I started to worry that I had been so anxious during my last 2 years of school that I didn’t get to enjoy the achievement. Yes there were great memories from this year, but it was overshadowed by the heavy weight of pressure I placed on myself to succeed. 

The feeling of depression started to sink in as I deferred from university and decided to work until I knew what I wanted to do. During this year, I worked two jobs (Mcdonalds, bar work). I worked upwards of 50 hours a week. Yes, the money was great but it took a serious toll on my health which was oblivious to me at the time. I most likely averaged around 4-5 hours of sleep per night. 

I lived in a constant misery. I wasn’t conscious of this for some time, however. It was so prominent that it became normal. It was extremely hard to keep everything together, and consistent. During the week periods where I was starting to enjoy regular/consistent sleep, exercise, social time, family time, rest time and creative time, I started to think it was too good to be true. In this moment, I started to worry that I was either dreaming that life was this good, and that it would only be like this for a short moment longer. I ‘jinxed’ myself to think so much and do so little.

### Types
There are different types of depression that I identified. They all intertwine regardless.
#### Internal
Firstly, it was an internal, self-inflicted depression. It was misery that I was never going to be happy at all. It derived from my indecisions surrounding my career. I was terrified to try anything. I shuddered at the thought of researching and making calls to figure out what I wanted to do. I think of this one as a box- stuck in a space which never allowed me to access outside my comfort zone, therefore deferring my access into the growth zone. 

Striving to establish a healthy, consistent schedule was a nightmare. My will-power often lacked, and each new schedule I made dissipated faster than the last. From this, the misery of what the future would hold sunk in indefinitely. I developed a need to drink with friends after my bar shifts. It was great fun, but underneath the fun it was essentially an escape from coming home to a bed where I would lay awake for hours, mind running amuck, often crying. I wasn’t actually facing the issues, and it was essentially making everything worse. 

This box I put myself in never made me appreciate the great life I have. I couldn’t appreciate the many blessings running past me. My addiction to social media and browsing for hours on hours attributed to this. Peeping into the lives of others- who portrayed themselves as happy and in control, was particularly discouraging for me to see clearly in terms of my personal career and future wellbeing. I could go into much more detail, but I think you catch my drift. This was self-inflicted. I wasn’t confident in who I was, and often compensated for the acclaim of others- which leads me to the second type of depression I identified.

#### External 
The second type was external. Obviously the opposite of self-inflicted. The way the world treated me was how I saw myself. This was primarily a result of deteriorating relationships I had to suffer through. Not only were these relationships from the past couple years, they reached as young as ages 13 and above. There was a part of me that never moved on or even learned from these younger situations, once again showing with the situations from ages 17 and above. I had some hurtful, traumatic endings to relationships which really screwed me up. Especially one that happened as I started 2019. I thought of myself as less significant, that my self worth was so miniscule compared to anyone else. 

Of course, I was afraid to talk to anyone about it, which, in hindsight, was so terribly stupid. I made up lies to protect and boost my reputation (something I now realise I’ve been doing for years) because I was ashamed of how different situations panned out. You should always remember that your mind intends to keep you safe. No matter how many lies it tells you, it intends to keep you safe. For someone who doesn’t over-complicate everything- it doesn’t infiltrate. To someone who overthinks everything- it infiltrates and takes control. A double-edged sword indeed.

An inherent desire to make my mark while I’m on this earth is also a double-edged sword which amplified my misery and constricted my productivity to do anything at all. Not knowing how or if I could even begin to have an impact, it ate at me. I will also add that I was fired from my bar job during this time. Not only embarrassing, but frustrating and depressing. With social media, I browsed constantly to see what people were doing. More invested in others, I was. These people showed off their ‘amazing’ lives and that did not help. Don’t get me wrong, it's great to see my idols and friends live a good life, as they are part of the reason I am who I am. However, this coincided with my lack of acceptance of the beautiful life I already had.

One more thing to note about my depression was that I felt ashamed to be this way. I have every reason to be happy. But I couldn’t find any sort of level ground. I believe this is due to the void that most who live in a generally comfortable setting deal with. Because you never had to struggle for the bare essentials, your idea or standard of living is much more privileged than others. Seeing people in 3rd world countries absolutely over the moon about getting access to the basic needs made me feel stupid for having this depression at all. I often questioned the meaning of life. What else did I need to be happy? Why can’t I simply be grateful? Will I ever truly be happy, or even just content?

## Suicidal thoughts and attempt
The thoughts began to surface as less of an actual attempt, but more of a decision in the heat of the moment. At times I hoped that something (out of my control) would happen to me. It was such a dark time full of emptiness and uncertainty that I couldn't even focus on any sort of hopeful thinking.


The story behind this is a puzzling one. For some context, I was starting to love life for the couple weeks before this happened. I had been engaging in healthy lifestyle behaviours on a consistent basis (sleep, eating, exercise, social) for around three weeks before this night. I had established a relationship (unofficial) with a great girl and we had been bonding well during this time period. I had no reason to believe I would end the night attempting to end it all.

### October 26th, 2019

It was a Saturday night. I was joining some friends for a night out at some local clubs. Everything was great. I had caught up with several friends I ran into on the night out. I only had around 4 drinks across the night, but was still having a great time. We finished our first round of dancing and sat down in some lounges with our drinks. Then, out of nowhere, something hit me.

It was the worst feeling I had ever felt before. It’s hard to explain, but best described as empty and full at the same time. Feeling nothing and everything. I tried to breathe slowly, and have some water but none of that worked. I’ve had panic attacks before, but this was different. This was an attack on a whole ‘nother level. With the help of some great friends, I found my way home alright. No one was home, except for my dad who was sleeping upstairs. I sat on the TV lounge and just bawled my eyes out. I still didn’t know what was wrong. I just wanted it to stop.

This is where the story takes a turn for the worst, just warning you. The many thoughts circulating in my head lead me to a scary conclusion: I wanted to kill myself. I needed a way out. I wasn’t thinking logically by going to my dad for help. I was stuck. I was stuck in my body but I could see everything I was doing to myself. I remember going into the pantry, and swallowing as many pills as I could. Who knows if these would’ve killed me, but I was hoping it would. Again, I couldn’t control any of this. I continued to ball my eyes out as I walked into the backyard and laid down. I tried to understand what had gone wrong in my life to push me to this point. The ‘bad wolf’ inside of me had accepted this as the way to go.

Luckily, with what I can only explain as a miracle, I regained control. I immediately vomited whatever I had consumed into some bushes in the backyard. I sat there for what felt like hours. I looked up at the stars into an oblivion. I continued to cry, as some of the best memories of my life flashed into my head. I was in shock, but thankful that I was still here. 

### This was a turning point for me. I do belong here!

## Closing notes
I wrote most of this memoir in the same area in which I attempted an impropmtu suicide around a year ago. It’s an eerie, awkward feeling to be in this room every day since it happened, but I’ve pushed through it. Just like anything, it took some perseverance. I could go on and on about the many traumatising experiences in detail, but that would not serve any purpose as I move forward in life. I need to acknowledge what has happened in the past, and move forward with a healthy attitude. I picked the suicide attempt because it was a turning point for me. It didn’t make everything better, but it altered my mindset. It’s what inspired me to start this project to help others and myself. I look to a quote I’ve constantly heard, for guidance: “What's in the dark will come to light”. My darkest moment comes to the light in the form of an honest expression. It’s an awkward delivery on a rough topic, but it’s necessary to hear.

Fast forward to now: Third lesson learnt: There is light at the end of the darkness.

I’m loving AFL more than I ever have. Still playing competitively and enjoying and embracing the challenge with confidence. A great group of teammates to play with, and an inviting culture. I have weeded out the indifferent, inconsistent friends and have formed friendships with some people who have nothing but good intentions and it feels great. I am exercising more regularly, taking walks, doing yoga with my mum, administrating frequent breathing techniques, being open with my family/friends, pursuing a passion project in music, and obviously: I am working on Path to Peace. Life is much better. I’m not there yet, but I’m on the way. I have a better understanding of how I can deal with anxiety and not let it run rampid in my life. I have strategies and tools. I still live with constant anxiety. I look at it as a reminder that I care about what I do with my time here. I’m working towards stability, and consistency. I know what works for me and what doesn’t, and I will continue to search for this for my sake and the sake of others. I believe that the lifestyle behaviours we run on a daily basis  are the #1 reason why we rise or we fall. What you CAN'T control should NOT control you. What you CAN control is all YOU can do. That is my focus now. They can be the difference between happiness and depression. As I walk this path, I hope you’ll walk it with me. There is a reason for the issues which plague all of us, and there is ample opportunity to make light out of this darkness. So say it with me:

# I am on the right path!

### Challenge Time!
Challenge yourself to be open. Tell your story. Write your blog. Come to peace with the past to start working for a better future. It feels amazing to be honest with yourself and others, so I challenge you to free yourself.
