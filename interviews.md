I sit down with someone to discuss their mental health.

The aim is to establish the issues and providing, in reflection:

+ Advice
+ Revelations
+ Hope

I highly recommend watching these in full (if you can!)

Feel free to [contact me](mailto:lachlan.querzoli@gmail.com) if you’d like to be featured in an interview!
